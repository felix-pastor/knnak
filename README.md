# knnak — Max for Live devices from my research project

These Max for Live devices are one of the outputs of a larger research project done in collaboration with Enric Guaus. Both devices were developed in the context of music composition and performance projects (ArInt, nanAI, Physis I and II) which were created in collaboration with Edurne Arizu.

## Requirements
- IRCAM's MUBU package installed in Max for Live.
- Devices tested in Live 12 (may work in other versions, not guaranteed).

## Usage
1. Load audio files into the sound bank. This can take some time — watch the Max console for slicing confirmation.
2. Devices use the input to capture the incoming signal.
3. The captured signal is analyzed and used to find a matching slice in the loaded audio.
4. Experiment with audio routings and controller mappings for different results.
5. If you find something you like or want to share feedback, please email us (contact details below).
